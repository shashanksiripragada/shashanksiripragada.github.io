I'm Shashank Siripragada. I'm working as a Research Fellow at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) where I am advised by [Dr. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). At CVIT, I'm involved in ongoing efforts to improve Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) systems for Indian Languages and also in curating parallel corpora to aid MNMT progress in Lwo-resourced Indian Languages. More details about the research can be found [here](http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~jerin/bhasha/).

Prior to joining CVIT as a Research Fellow, I worked at Primera as a Data Scientist where my role was to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare delivery costs through predictive modelling. I have built few models for early detection and intervention in case of patients at risk of certain diseases and clinical outcomes. Beyond predictive modelling, I also built dashboards to track Claims and Denials at enterprise level to assist Denial Management team.
